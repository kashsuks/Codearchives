    "description": "You just started a scorekeeping internship at Codearchives’ basketball team. It’s a very prestigious job, and you don’t want to lose it, but you’re also extremely lazy. So you don’t count the score. Instead, you count the number of free throws ( 1 point ) and field goals ( 2 or 3 points). So your job is to find the total points when given the different types of goals scored.",
    "inputSpec": "The input consists of 3 lines:\n  - The first line consists of the number of 1-pointers\n  - The second line consists of the number of 2-pointers\n   - The third line consists of the number of 3-pointers",
